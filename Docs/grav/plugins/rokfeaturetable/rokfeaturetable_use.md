    3. **Built-in CSS** RokFeatureTable comes with a default style that integrates well with many Grav themes. If you want to use your own, or if the theme you are using supports a custom style, you might want to set this param to No. [50%, 58%, sw]
    4. **Theme Selection**: RokFeatureTables has the ability to import predefined templates from **wp_content/plugins/wp_rokfeaturetable/templates/**. RokFeatureTable comes with two predefined templates as examples: Browsers and Price Table. [57%, 68%, sw]
    5. **Current Table Layout** This area of the menu sets the size and content of the feature table. It is the most important component of the widget setup process. More details about this menu are located in the [Table Layout](rokfeaturetable_use.md#table-layout) section below. [73%, 70%, sw]

Table Layout

You can access the table layout options via the widget properties menu. This tool allows you to create and fill your feature table with information that includes everything from basic text to custom CSS classes, subline text, links, and styles.

:   1. **Columns** You can add or remove columns to your feature table. Columns can be individually highlighted to emphasize the included content. [21%, 5%, ne]
    2. **Rows** Each column can have an independent number of rows. You can add or remove rows using the **+** or **-** controls. Each row within a column acts as a single cell. [29%, 49%, sw]
    3. **Class** You can use the class control to add a unique CSS class to the cell. [29%, 56%, sw]
    4. **Subline** This option allows you to add a sub-line of text to the cell. This is useful for disclaimers or extra information. [29%, 64%, sw]

Custom Themes
-----
Creating custom themes is very easy. You just need your favorite text editor and some knowledge on how the syntax is. Below an example of custom theme that we are going to cover on all its aspects.

~~~ .html
name::padding-top:10px;|Firefox
name-sub::Gecko Engine
name-classes::class2 class3
button-text::Download
button-text-sub::free
button-text-link::http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all.html
---
name::padding-top:10px;|Chrome
name-sub::WebKit Engine
name-classes::class2 class3
button-text::Download
button-text-sub::free
button-text-link::http://www.google.com/chrome
---
name::padding-top:10px;|Safari
name-sub::WebKit Engine
name-classes::class2 class3
button-text::Download
button-text-sub::free
button-text-link::http://www.apple.com/safari/download/
---
name::padding-top:10px;|Opera
name-sub::Presto Engine
name-classes::class2 class3
button-text::Download
button-text-sub::free
button-text-link::http://www.opera.com/browser/

Each Column is separated by 3 dashes `---`, so every time you are done writing rows, to 'switch' to another column, just add `---`.

To create a row, or even better, a cell, you start typing the class name of the reference followed by two colons `::`. Let's ignore all the columns and let's just take as reference the first one. Even without knowing the syntax, yet, you can easily tell all the columns and rows are equals, what makes them difference are just the values, but not the structure.

~~~ .html
name::padding-top:10px;|Firefox
name-sub::Gecko Engine
name-classes::class2 class3
button-text::Download
button-text-sub::free
button-text-link::http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all.html

So, as said earlier, we started writing a cell `name::padding-top:10px;|Firefox`. This translated means: "Create a cell, use as referenced class name 'name', add some in-line styling `padding-top:10px;` and use **Firefox** as text of the cell.

In the case that you want that cell to have a subline, the next line of the code would contain something like: `name-sub::Gecko Engine`. As you can see, 'name' has been kept for referencing to the 'name' cell, but we added a new keyword `-sub`. That is what lets RokFeatureTable know that our second line in the code needs to be a subline of 'name'. Translation: "In the cell that has 'name' as reference class add a subline with the text 'Gecko Engine'".

Now, let's say we want our cell to have additional classes. To do so, follow the same rules of '-sub', we write: `name-classes::class2 class3`, which translates to: "In the cell that has 'name' as reference class, I also need other classnames: `class2` and `class3`".

What follows is not prefixed by any 'name' anymore. That means we are done with the 'name' cell and we are switching to a new one, 'button-text'.

Everything is exactly as in 'name' cell, except we have a new keyword, `-link`.

NOTE: All the referenced cells allows HTML syntax, if instead of just plain "Firefox" (in the example above), we wanted a bold, red and italic "Firefox" (Firefox) this is how we would have written our cell: `name::padding-top:10px;|<strong style="color:red;"><em>Firefox</em></b>`
