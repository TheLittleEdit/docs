![][features]

Features is a content slideshow/showcase layout mode. It can display both images and text, or images only, with varying options on their display. Here is a look at the options screen for the Features layout mode.

Themes
-----

The **Features** layout mode has three built-in themes. These include: **Slideshow**, **Slideshow2**, and **Showcase**.

![][slideshow]

The **Slideshow** theme is all about your images. This theme makes your image the background of the widget, overlaying the item's title and description in an elegant, modern way.

![][slideshow2]

The **Slideshow2** theme also gives your images center stage. It presents content in a way that doesn't distract from the image. 

![][showcase]

The **Showcase** theme is a modern, easy to read and follow approach that gives you the ability to have a great looking widget, with or without an accompanying image.

Setup

1. The **Title** is the label you wish to give the RokSprocket instance. This is only used as a label on the backend, as the widget title will be what appears on the frontend of the site.

2. The **Filtered Article List** gives you access to item-specific settings including:

    * **Title** - Allows you to override the post title in the widget. The post title will be used if this is left at *Default*.
    * **Description** - Allows you to set a description for the feature. If this is left at *Default* the introtext from the post is used. 
    * **Image** - This allows you to circumvent the assigned image from the post and replace it with one specifically for the feature. 
    * **Link** - If set, the link will show a *Read More** button as well as link the title. On specific themes, it will link the image in the feature, as well.

3. The **Content Filter Rules** section gives you the ability to determine how the widget will pull content to make up the features. For example, you can have the widget pull posts that are within a specific category, contain a particular name or keyword in the title, or choose specific posts. You can also modify how this content is sorted in the widget.

Below the **Content Filter Rules** section are two options areas specific to the layout mode you have chosen. We have broken down the **Features Layout Options** and **Features Article Defaults** sections below.
