## Introduction

![](assets/particle_simplebooking1.jpg)

The **Simple Booking** particle is a Simple Form powered form enabling visitors to find something that meets their needs and is available on the date(s) they need it, and send you a request to book it via email. This particular particle is a perfect choice for any business that deals with reservations such as hotels.

Of course, like any particle, this can also be customized to connect to any number of different simplebooking systems with a little know-how. By default, it uses the Simple Form service which is a clean, simple way to receive contact information and gather other details about your customer's interest in your products/services. Simple Form will email you each time the form is filled out and submitted by a visitor, along with the information you need to set up reservations.

You will need a Simple Form token in order for this particle to work. You can get one from [Simple Form's website](https://getsimpleform.com/) with your email address. They will email a token to you, and you can easily insert it into the **Simple Form Token** field of the particle. Once this is done, any submissions will be emailed to you as well as made available through the Simple Form website in a private link emailed along with your token.
