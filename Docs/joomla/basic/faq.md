### How do I know which version of Gantry I have installed on my site?

There are a few different ways to find out. In both **Joomla 2.5** and **3.x**, go to **Admin-> Extensions -> Template Manager** and open your tempalte. Then, you will want to click the **Overview** tab.

There should be an info box on the right-hand side that tells you which version of Gantry you are currently running, and if there is an update available.

Another option would be to go to **Admin -> Extensions -> Extensions Manager** and use the **Filter** to find **Gantry**. The version will appear in this list.

### I am not seeing any changes on my Joomla site after editing something.

Make sure you have cleared your Joomla and browser cache before refreshing your site. The steps for doing this are listed below.
