![][splitmenu]

There are two menu options, Triple Level SplitMenu and Fusion. The latter is a CSS based dropdown menu. Triple Level Splitmenu splits the first level, second level and all further menu items, allowing for for a navigation bar, a dropline and a sidemenu, as configurable.

Template side RTL support from the Fusion menu to the Typography; alongside Gantry's RTL support for the automatic flipping of the grid system. If Joomla is set to RTL mode, in its language settings, the template will automatically adjust to its RTL layout.
