### Sidepanel

![][sidepanel]

The Sidepanel is forced on every page, and has a grid distribution of 3, leaving 9 to the Mainbody. Therefore, the Gantry layout controls only allow you to edit the Mainbody/Sidebar distribution, and not the Sidepanel distribution. You can switch the left/right position.

### E-Commerce

The template has integrated styling for a selection of different e-commerce extensions: Ecwid, a 3rd party and platform independent shopping solution that is wrapped into Joomla by RokEcwid; and Tienda & redSHOP, integrated Joomla e-commerce extensions.
