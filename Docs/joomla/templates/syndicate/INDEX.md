### 16 Grid Layout

![][grid]

Gantry offers a grid system, splitting module position rows into blocks of up to 6 modules, side by side. Their widths can be adjusted in the administrator. This is based off of 12, such as 4|4|4, but with Syndicate, this is 16, allowing for more precision such as 6|6|4.

### Extensions Styling

![][extensions]

Syndicate has compatibility styling for 7 major third party extensions: K2, JComments, Contact Form Enhanced, Tienda, NinjaBoard, Virtuemart and JomSocial. The extensions will not be included in the RocketLauncher, but can be acquired from the respective developers.
