## Introduction

![](assets/particle_promo1.jpeg)

The **Promo Content** particle is a great way  

Here are the topics covered in this guide:

* [Configuration](#configuration)
    - [Main Options](#main-options)
    - [Item Options](#item-options)

## Configuration

### Main Options 

These options affect the main area of the particle, and not the individual items within. For example, if you want to display content that includes a title, headline, image, and link you can do so here, but if you want to display numerous individual items, each with their own text, images, and/or links, you can do so using the **Promo Items** collection feature.
