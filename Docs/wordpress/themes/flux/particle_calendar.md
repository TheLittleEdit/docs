## Introduction

![](assets/particle_calendar1.jpeg)

The **Calendar** particle enables you to create a calendar, complete with events and HTML descriptions, with ease.

>> NOTE: Certain elements of the calendar, including which day of the week a week starts on, are based on the language pack assigned to the page the calendar is displayed in. For example, `en-US` results in Sunday appearing as the first day of the calendar week.

Here are the topics covered in this guide:
